# Problem 1

Load the dataset:

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

This dataset includes 358 rows and 15 columns.

Its variables include `origin` with character value “EWR”;
`year, month, day, hour` with the recording time, `temp, dewp, humid`
with the recorded float data type of temperature, dewpoint, and
humidity; `wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust` with the recorded floating
value of wind direction, speed, and gust speed (which contains much
missing values); `precip` with almost all of its numeric values of
precipitation as 0; `pressure` with most of the value of sea level
pressure close to 1000 or missing; `visib` with the recorded floating
value of visibility; `time_hour` with the date value corresponding to
the columns of `year, month, day, hour`.

The mean temperature is 39.5821229.

The scatterplot of temperature against the date is shown here:

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color= humid)) + geom_point()
```

It seems like the temperature fluctuates with an tendency of increase
(approximately from 25F to 50F) as time passes, and the humidity level
increases as well. The scatterplot behaves like a line chart in a
discrete form.

This scatterplot is exported to the directory as a pdf document, named
as “p8105_hw1_scatterplot”:

``` r
ggsave("p8105_hw1_scatterplot.pdf")
```

# Problem 2

Create a data frame named “p8105_hw1_df”:

``` r
p8105_hw1_df <- tibble(rand_vec = rnorm(10),
                       logical_vec = rand_vec > 0,
                       char_vec = c("1mean(pull(p8105_hw1_df, var=2))","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10"),
                       fac_vec = factor(c(1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3)))
```

Using the `pull` function to try take the mean of each variable in the
dataframe:

``` r
# Mean of the random sample:
mean(pull(p8105_hw1_df, var=1))
```

    ## [1] -0.4977728

``` r
# Mean of the logical vector:
mean(pull(p8105_hw1_df, var=2))
```

    ## [1] 0.3

``` r
# This generates an error:
# mean(pull(p8105_hw1_df, var=3))
# This generates an error:
# mean(pull(p8105_hw1_df, var=4))
```

Using the `as_numeric` functions to convert the logical, character, and
factor variables to numeric values:

``` r
as.numeric(pull(p8105_hw1_df, var=2))
as.numeric(pull(p8105_hw1_df, var=3))
as.numeric(pull(p8105_hw1_df, var=4))
```

For the logical vector, since by default, `TRUE` is 1 and `FALSE` is 0,
I can take the mean of this vector directly, without the necessity of
transforming it to numeric values.

After the numeric transformation, I can take the mean of the character
vector, which is NA. This is because inside the character values
themselves are not considered as numeric values for computation, even if
they contain numbers (like “1”, “2”, etc.)

Also, I can take the mean of the factor vector, which is 2. This is
because inside the original factor vector, the factor level itself
cannot be specified as numeric values in order to conduct calculations.
